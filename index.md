## 🚀 Quick Start

- **[Setup Instructions](dev_guides/setup_instructions.md)**  
  Set up container tools, SSH keys, and understand download-as-you-go vs pre-download options.

- **[Sample & Genotype QC Pipeline](ind_geno_qc.md)**  
  Run the main QC pipeline for your study data.

- **[Phenotype Processing](phenotyping.md)**  
  Adjust and transform phenotypes for analysis.

- **[Pre-phasing Checks](pre_phasing_checks.md)**  
  Ensure your data is ready for phasing.

- **[GWAS Pipeline](gwas.md)**  
  Perform genome-wide association analysis.

- **[Post-GWAS Checks](post_gwas_checks.md)**  
  Automated QC and reporting for GWAS results.
